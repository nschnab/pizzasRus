/*
 * This file is where you will implement the methods needed to support this application.
 * You will write the code to retrieve and save information to the database and use that
 * information to build the various objects required by the applicaiton.
 * 
 * The class has several hard coded static variables used for the connection, you will need to
 * change those to your connection information
 * 
 * This class also has static string variables for pickup, delivery and dine-in. 
 * DO NOT change these constant values.
 * 
 * You can add any helper methods you need, but you must implement all the methods
 * in this class and use them to complete the project.  The autograder will rely on
 * these methods being implemented, so do not delete them or alter their method
 * signatures.
 * 
 * Make sure you properly open and close your DB connections in any method that
 * requires access to the DB.
 * Use the connect_to_db below to open your connection in DBConnector.
 * What is opened must be closed!
